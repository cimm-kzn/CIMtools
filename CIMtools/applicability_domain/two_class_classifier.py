    Model learns to distinguish inliers from outliers.
    Objects with high prediction error in cross-validation (more than 3xRMSE) are considered outliers,
    while the rest are inliers.
    Two-class classification methods is trained to distinguish them, and provides the value of confidence that
    object belongs to inliers. The latter is used as a measure that object is in AD.
    In this case, Random Forest Classifier implemented in scikit-learn library is used.
    The method requires fitting of two hyperparameters: max_features and probability threshold P*.
    If the objectâ€™s predicted probability of belonging to the inliers is greater than P*,
    its prediction is considered reliable (within AD).
    Other hyperparameters of Random Forest Classifier were set to defaults,
    except number of decision trees in RF was set to 500.

        Model building and threshold searching
        During training, a model is built and a probability threshold is found by which the object is considered to
        belong to the applicability domain of the model.
        For this reason, in fit method we pass the following parameters:
        reg_model and clf_model. Reg_model is regression model, clf_model is classification model.
