class SimilarityDistance(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    """ Distance-based method for  defining applicability domain (AD).

    In the case of non-linear kNN QSPR method, since the models are based on chemical similarity calculations,
    a large similarity distance could signal query compounds too dissimilar to the training set compounds.
    This approach is based on providing similarity measure for a new chemical with respect to the compounds within
    the training space. The similarity is identified by finding the distance of a query chemical from the nearest
    training compound or its distances from k nearest neighbors in the training set.
    If the calculated distance values of test set compounds are not within the user-defined threshold set by
    the training set molecules, then the prediction of these compounds are considered to be unreliable.
    Commonly threshold calculated like Dc=Zσ + <y>, where <y> is the average and σ is the standard deviation of the
    Euclidean distances of the k nearest neighbors of each compound in the training set and Z is an empirical parameter
    to control the significance level, with the default value of 0.5.

    Drawback of method is lack of strict rules in literature towards defining the thresholds can lead to ambiguous
    results. We propose a variation of finding threshold. Threshold in the approach was optimized in course internal
    cross-validation procedure by maximize our metric.

    NB! To the nearest first neighbor

    Parameters
    ----------
    leaf_size : positive integer (default = 40)
        Number of points at which to switch to brute-force. Changing leaf_size will not affect the results of a query,
        but can significantly impact the speed of a query and the memory required to store the constructed tree.
        The amount of memory needed to store the tree scales as approximately n_samples / leaf_size. For a specified
        leaf_size, a leaf node is guaranteed to satisfy leaf_size <= n_points <= 2 * leaf_size, except in the case that
        n_samples < leaf_size.

    metric : string or DistanceMetric object
        The distance metric to use for the tree. Default=’minkowski’ with p=2 (that is, a euclidean metric).
        See the documentation of the DistanceMetric class for a list of available metrics. ball_tree.valid_metrics gives
         a list of the metrics which are valid for BallTree.

    threshold : string or float
        It needs to compare the distance values with threshold. If the calculated distance values of test set compounds
        are not within the threshold set by the training set molecules, then the prediction of these
        compounds are considered to be unreliable.

        - If auto, threshold calculated like Dc = Zσ + <y>, where <y> is the average and σ is the standard deviation of
            the Euclidean distances of the k nearest neighbors of each compound in the training set and
            Z is an empirical parameter to control the significance level, with the default value of 0.5.
        - If 'cv', threshold in the approach is optimized in course internal cross-validation procedure
            by maximize our metric.
        - IF float, threshold will be this value

    score : string
        A metric is required to find a threshold.

        - If score is 'ba_ad' is calculated balanced accuracy. The true inliers and outliers are those for
            which the difference in the prediction error is less than 3 RMSE
        - If score is 'rmse_ba' is calculated Root Mean Squared Error of model with AD. Sahigata and etc proposed [1]
            to use difference between root mean squared error outliers and inliers (RMSE_AD), which shows
            what is predicted better: objects outside AD or objects inside and outside AD.
            The metric characterizes how accurate the model becomes. By inliers, we mean objects inside AD,
            and by outliers, objects outside AD.

    reg_model : None or estimator
        It needs for finding threshold
